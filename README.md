# Yes/No Classification Using SGD, Random Forest & SVC Classifiers Based on Fast Fourier Transform

In this project we're looking for classifying "Yes" or "No" sounds using 3 different classification models and also compare their predictions vector with each other.

The dataset has been formatted as .wav files with 16 kHz sampling rate, so first of all we're going to get the array of each instance and then computing fft of them for our model input.
