# Yes/No Voice Command Classification Using Stochastic Gradient Descent, Random Forest & Support Vector Classifiers Based on Fast Fourier Transform

In this project we're looking for classifying "Yes" or "No" voice commands using three different classification algorithms and also comparing their predictions vector with each other.

## Dataset:

The dataset has been formatted as .wav files with 16 kHz sampling rate, so first of all we're going to get the array of each instance and then computing fft of them for our model input.
